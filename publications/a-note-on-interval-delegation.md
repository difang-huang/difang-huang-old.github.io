#### Abstract

In this note we extend the Amador and Bagwell (2013) conditions for confirming
the optimality of a proposed interval delegation set to the possibility of degenerate
intervals, in which the agent takes the same action at every state. We consider the
cases of money burning as well as no money burning. These results allow us to provide
new sufficient conditions on utility functions and state distributions to guarantee that
some interval â€“ degenerate or non-degenerate - will be optimal.
