### Exams

I have created a practice [midterm](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/7796025/Teaching/FE312/PracticeExams/PracticeMidterm.pdf) and [final](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/7796025/Teaching/FE312/PracticeExams/PracticeFinal.pdf) exam. Solutions to these can be found [here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/7796025/Teaching/FE312/PracticeExams/PracticeMidtermSolutions.pdf) and [here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/7796025/Teaching/FE312/PracticeExams/PracticeFinalSolution.pdf), respectively.
